  # Init-backend: Streamline Your Backend Projet Setup

Init-backend is a tool designed to streamline the development of backend projects by offering a variety of pre-configured templates. With init-backend, you can quickly kickstart a new project by choosing from different frameworks, architectures, and tools that best suit your needs.

## 🚀 Features
- **Diverse Templates:** Choose from a range of templates differing in frameworks (such as Express, NestJS) and its structures. Obs: For now only one template created, but I accept your contribution to create new well-assembled templates 🤗.
- **Easy to Use:** Init-backend is designed with simplicity in mind. Start a new project with just a few commands, no complex configurations required.
- **Up-to-Date:** Our templates are regularly updated to ensure they utilize the latest versions of frameworks and libraries, keeping your project modern and secure.
